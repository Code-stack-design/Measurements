# Body Measurement to Clothing Size Converter

A simple Java console application that converts user-input body measurements (in inches or centimeters) into clothing sizes for **H&M** and **Zara**, covering both male and female categories.

##  Features

- Accepts measurement unit (in/cm) and user measurements (chest/bust, waist).
- Converts inches to centimeters if needed.
- Maps measurements to relevant size categories using real-world data:
  - **H&M Men's (Tops/Shirts)** — based on chest/waist ranges in cm.
  - **Zara Men's Shirts (Alpha Sizes)** — chest ranges in cm for S, M, L, XL, XXL.
- Simplified mapping for women (H&M & Zara) using typical size ranges (editable for greater accuracy).
